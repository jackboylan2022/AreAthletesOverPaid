	<h1> <strong> <u> Are Athletes Overpaid? </u> </strong> </h1>
 <h3> <strong> <u> Athletes are overpaided </u> </strong> </h3>  <p> According to <a href =  "https://nsucurrent.nova.edu/2014/12/11/on-the-bench-overpaid-athletes/"> Nsucurrent </a> "the reality is that there are individuals with more important jobs - that is, those whose jobs affect society in a positive manner - who make significantly less. It's not shocking that public servants like teachers and police officers make less than professional athletes." <br> "Athletes exorbitant wages are shocking but certainly not unusual. Some may envy athletes salaries, but that's no surprise when the median household income in the United States is about $50,000. Meanwhile, Lebron James makes $19 million in one year and is still considered - you guessed it - underpaid."<br>
</p>
<br>
 <h3><strong> <u> Athletes are perfectly paid </u> </strong> </h3>  <p> According to <a href = "https://sports.cbslocal.com/2015/06/16/athletes-money-contracts/"> CBS Local </a> "Whether you're becoming a doctor or a pro athlete,  <br> it requires the same level of dedication and hours spent. The only difference is in the odds."<br> "The threshold to entry is so close to impossible for pro athletes that it makes the profession infinitely more valuable. The fact that not just anyone can do it, and you need to be blessed with an otherworldly talent in order to participate, makes it worth the money."

<h2> My Opinion </h2>
<p class = "opinion"> 	In my opinion, I think that sports player are paided perfectly. <br> They're advantages to being a professional athlete but they're disadvantages to being a pro, like privacy, pressure to succed, etc. <br> Also athetes put their body on the line for their job.<br> Athlete's bodys get destroyed and a lot of athletes have mental heath issues (specialy football players). <br> I don't think its fair that jobs like teachers and police officers don't get paid nearly the amount athletes get paid but that not because athletes get paid too much but because the teachers and officers don't get paid enough. <br>    </p>
